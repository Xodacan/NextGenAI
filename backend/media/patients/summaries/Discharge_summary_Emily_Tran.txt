Hospital Course
----------------
The patient, Emily, was admitted to our hospital on 27-Aug-2025 due to respiratory distress and a positive viral panel for Rhinovirus. Overnight, the patient received nebulized salbutamol and ipratropium bromide, oral prednisolone, and high-flow oxygen therapy as needed. The patient's condition improved, and by morning, the SpO2 was 99% RA with a respiratory rate of 20.

Clinical Findings
------------------
On admission, the patient presented with mild wheeze bilaterally, good air entry, and an SpO2 of 97% RA on 2 L O₂. The patient was irritable but consolable in the mother's lap. Vitals: T 37.2 °C, HR 152, RR 38, BP 92/56. The patient had eczema on flexures and no rashes.

Treatment and Management
-------------------------
The patient received nebulized salbutamol and ipratropium bromide every 2 hours, oral prednisolone 20 mg, and high-flow oxygen therapy as needed. The patient was also educated on the correct use of MDI spacer and the difference between preventer and reliever medications. A written asthma action plan was completed, and a school copy was prepared.

Social Work Intervention
-------------------------
The social worker, J. Holmes, provided information on Carer's allowance and reassured the family regarding hospital no-cost public care. The school was notified to expect the child the following day if discharged. The family lives 15 minutes from the hospital, and the father works FIFO.

Dietary Intervention
---------------------
The dietician, L. Fernando, found that the patient's intake was normal with no weight loss. Advice was given to continue a balanced diet and offer small frequent meals if the patient experiences wheeziness post-neb. No specific restrictions were necessary.

Physiotherapy Intervention
--------------------------
The physiotherapist, S. Nguyen, assessed the patient with no sputum production and a dry cough. Air entry was symmetrical. The intervention included teaching bubble PEP for 5 breaths to maintain airway patency and advised no formal chest PT was required.

Final Assessment and Plan
--------------------------
On Day 2 of the hospital course, Emily slept 6 hours straight without any wheeze heard, SpO2 96-98% RA overnight. The patient's respiratory rate was 22-26 with occasional cough. A chest X-ray was taken to exclude pneumonia/complications (results pending). The final plan included a change to salbutamol MDI + spacer 2 puffs q4h, the final prednisolone dose, and final teaching & observation today. Likely discharge this afternoon if stable.

Follow-up Arrangements
----------------------
The patient will have a follow-up appointment with their general practitioner within 48 hours of discharge. A referral to the Paediatric Respiratory Clinic for a review in 4 weeks was also arranged. The mother is comfortable escalating care per the action plan provided.
